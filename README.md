# 🎓🩸 Freshman's Fear

_A horror escape game born from group projects, bad lighting, and worse decisions._

## 🖤 What’s this?

**Freshman’s Fear** is a *first-person psychological horror* set in a university building that has no chill.  
You either escape before sunrise or become part of the academic decor. Your sanity is on a timer, and the building? It's very much alive.

## 🔪 Core Features (a.k.a. Why You’ll Cry Playing)

- 🗝️ **Exploration** — open doors, open minds (wait, what?)
- 🧠 **Sanity System** — the more you see, the less you want to
- 🎥 **Cutscenes** — cinematic horror that actually *slaps*
- 🕯️ **Generators & Light** — power up your soul (and the map)
- ☕ **Consumables** — coffee & snacks = survival tools, obviously
- 👻 **Reactive Enemies** — if you see them, they’ve already heard you
- 🧩 **Puzzles** — solve them or perish (no pressure)
